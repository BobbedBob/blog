# OSINT: Zer0C00l
> You used to call me on my cellphone.

## Provided Clues

* We are provided with an audio clip of someone connecting to dial-up internet.  
* This phone number is from Sydney.  
* This happened in 1995\.  
* We need to try harder.

## Chasing the Goose

Now, we must remember, 
# `this is NOT forensics. This is OSINT.`
*(do not try to read the dial-up sound effect that happened AFTER the initial DTMF sounds)*
Repeat that 3 times before continuing.

Okay. So, by using Google or any research tool, we know that to connect to the dial-up internet, or some sort of modem using dial-up internet, **we must first dial the phone number of that modem**.  
This is done through **DTMF** *(Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency)*, this is the audio that plays when you press a number key on phones even to this day.  
	  
Using Google, we can find [an online DTMF reader](https://dtmf.netlify.app/).

This way, we can find that the number they have dialed, is, at least, some parts of, is **3693244**.  

Now, if you live in Australia, you will quickly find that that is no longer the number format we use anymore. In Australia, the phone number now is (**01\) 23 456 789\.**

There are often 10 digits instead of 7\. Even with the added area code prefix of Sydney, which is **(02)**, that still leaves us with **(02) 369 3244**.  

What’s going on here?

## Ask a Boomer

Now, in 1995, **landlines and modems can still just have 7 digits after the area code, so in 1995, that would have been a perfectly normal phone number that you can call**.  
So, now we just need to find out **who owns this number.**

We will need to look up this number on Google, maybe in a few different formats as they might have been listed in an irregular format, **who knows what happened in 1995\. I can’t imagine being a millennial\!**

Trying many different formats of the same thing is quite a common strategy, see from [IrisCTF 2024 Write-ups - OSINT: Harsh Reality of Passwords](/cybersecurity/2024/01/08/irisctf-24.html).

**In Australia, when you use the international calling code to call an Australian phone number, you generally always remove the 0 at the front.**  

Let’s try:

| 023693244 | (02) 369 3244 | (02) 3693 244 |
| \+61 23693244 | \+61 (2) 369 3244 | \+61 (2) 3693 244 |
| \+61 023693244 | \+61 (02) 369 3244 | \+61 (02) 3693 244 |
| \+61-02-369-3244 |  | \+61-02-3693-244 |
| **\+61-2-369-3244** |  | \+61-2-3693-244 |

	  
Indeed, **\+61-2-369-3244** leads us somewhere. All other phone numbers will result in absolutely nothing.  
***You may need to turn SafeSearch off**.*

We can find this [list of BBS’s in 1995](http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/nightowl-016/002A/GBBS9504/GBBS9504.TXT), incidentally, that phone number just so happens to be on there\!

## Solution

This reveals the flag to be `DUCTF{Hotline\_BBS}`.

# OSINT: yippee
> You son of a beach.

## Provided Clues

## Chasing the Goose

First, we want to analyse this picture.  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/fubDaO.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/fubDaO.png)  
Now, we must analyse the clues one by one.  

This sign is a very generic **tide warning** sign in Australia, as evident when you try to image search this thing.  
So, something important would be the steep hills in the background. That is a unique feature to this beach or image. Let’s image search just that portion.  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/dokzm2.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/dokzm2.png)

This will yield these results:  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/xNunZg.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/xNunZg.png)  

Now, I am very curious as to what happened in the first image, and why they are all blurred out. Sydney people must be very… ***expressive**.*

But that’s not relevant.

Every other image has led us to the same location, **Port Macquire, Nobby’s Beach and Flynn’s Beach.**

## Solution

We can either try all these three flags one by one, or we can use Google Maps Street View, to finally rest the location on **Nobbys Beach, Port Macquire…?**  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/qmYf3N.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/qmYf3N.png)

Weirdly enough, this was not the flag. Although we can see the hills and views are almost **an exact match**, the flag was **Flynn’s Beach,** being `DUCTF{Flynns_Beach}`.  

This is probably to avoid a conflict between **Nobby’s Beach, Port Macquarie** and an identically named **Nobby’s Beach, Newcastle.**

# OSINT: Look at all those chickens!
## *Where did you get that hoodie? And how do I get one?*

## Provided Clues

![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/FpLIqC.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/FpLIqC.png)

## Chasing the Goose

Use **Google Image Search**. Selecting the important portion of the image, that being the central island and the little bit of residential area on the right.  
We can find this article [talking about a Bin Chicken Island](https://www.pedestrian.tv/travel/bin-chicken-island/).  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/k3KUnf.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/k3KUnf.png)

Using **Google Maps** we can find this location in Coburg, Victoria.  
![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/jheFRA.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/jheFRA.png)  
The challenge mentioned the location we are looking for is…  
**“... can you find out the name of the place where these birds were locked up?”**

Now, let’s find where those bin chickens were locked up. Searching for the keyword **“prison”** on Google Maps, and there it is\! The **Pentridge Prison.**

## Solution

![https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/ZW9Nbz.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2025/11/21/ZW9Nbz.png)  
And thus, the flag is `DUCTF{Pentridge_Prison}`

# Afterword

This was the first time I did DownUnder CTF. The OSINT challenges were ***interesting***, I think the most unique one was **Zer0C00l**, as all other challenges were either a simple Google Image search away, or some derivation of that.  
Some flags were quite misleading, as well as the hints. I am also not too confident in if spamming “try harder” gifs are exactly the least taunting way to say “no hints”.
