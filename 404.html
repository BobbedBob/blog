    In computer network communications, the HTTP 404 Not Found error message is a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
    standard response code, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server
    could not find what was requested. The error may also be used when a server does not wish to disclose whether it
    has the requested information. The website hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page
    when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognisable errors
    encountered on the World Wide Web.
